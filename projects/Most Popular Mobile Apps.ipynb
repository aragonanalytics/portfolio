    "Our goal with this project is to analyze which mobile apps are the most popular in the Apple App Store and Google Play markets. We work for a company that builds free apps (both Android and iOS) that generate revenue through in-app advertisements. Therefore, it is crucial that we equip our developer team with data-driven information on what apps are most appealing to users, as the number of users will directly influence our profits. "

    "Due to the abundance of free gaming apps that we found previously, it is possible that a pratical app (such as Reference, Book, or Productivity genres), could attract more users. The App Store is oversatuated with gaming and entertainment apps compared to the Google Play market, but the number of user reviews in the practical categories is promising. For instance, the Book genre averages 39758 user ratings and Productivity has an average of 21028. Since we are using in-app advertisements to generate revenue, we would want users to spend time in the app. An app in the Weather, Finance, or Food & Drink genres would likely not keep users in the app for a long enough time since these are apps that users visit for a short time to fulfull a specific purpose (check the forecast, order a drink, transfer money, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps an app that overlaps into several practical genres would prove successful, such as a scheduling app that combines elements from Productivity, Weather, Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, and Entertainment. For instance, a scheduling app could appear in the Productivity genre but allow users to track their habits, receive book and movie recommendations based on their preferences, and provide recommendations based on today's weather. Maybe they have a break in their schedule, it's sunny out, and the app can recommend taking a walk outdoors. It can remind users to drink water throughout the workday, and then recommend a book to read or movie to watch in the evening based on the likes/dislikes they've set in their profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, apps that target users' practical needs may stand out on the App Store. "

This number is still quite competitive with other app genres; for instance, Health and Fitness apps show around 4 million installations on average.

    "Based on our analysis of the most popular apps from the App Store and Google Play store, we concluded that creating a productivity app that includes unique and pratical features could be profitable in both markets. The App Store showed an oversaturation of fun apps, such as games and entertainment, but pratical apps brought in the most reviews. In the Google Play store, productivity apps average ~3.4 million installs even with Microsoft and G Suite apps removed from the analysis. A well-designed scheduling app with unique features could potentially stand out in both markets, and would generate ad revenue because users would frequently open it and use it for several minutes at a time."
